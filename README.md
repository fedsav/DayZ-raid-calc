# DayZ-raid-calc
Actually this is my first frontend pet projct using SCSS and Webpack :) This app helps you to raid enemy bases in DayZ more efficiency

The usage is pretty simple: enter your ammo, choose door HP multiplier and click on final count button. Appeared number is how many door you can successfully raid.
Actual for 1.19 DayZ vesion.
